# 🧠 Single-Layer Perceptron

Welcome to this classic machine learning project! This repository contains a **Python** implementation of a **single-layer perceptron**, also known as a **simple neural network**, proposed by **Frank Rosenblatt** in 1958 and inspired by the neural model of **McCulloch and Pitts** (1943).

---

## 📘 Description

The perceptron simulates the basic behavior of a brain neuron:

- It receives inputs 🧾 (`x`)
- Each input is multiplied by a **weight** 📊 (`w`)
- An **activation function** is applied (`z = w·x + b`)
- If the result exceeds a certain **threshold** (`θ`), the neuron is **activated** 🔥

This algorithm is a **binary linear classifier**, used for **supervised learning**.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🐍 Implemented in **Python**
- 🎯 Performs **binary classification**
- 📈 Step-by-step training with weight updates
- 🧪 Includes **visualizations** of training results
